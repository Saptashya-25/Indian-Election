Step 2 Indian Election.do Cleaning file: 
This code uses the election data for India that has been downloaded from the election commission and creates the variables of unscheduled and scheduled elections of India from 1951 to 2020. This code also creates a variable that tracks the election cycle of India from its republic in 1950 until 2020.
